# Week 6 - Advice for Applying Machine Learning
- This week, we will walk you through a complex, end-to-end application of machine learning, to the application of Photo OCR. 
- Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. 
- We discuss how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system.
